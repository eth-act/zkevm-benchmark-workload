<h1 align="center">zkEVM Benchmarking Workload</h1>

This workspace contains code for executing Ethereum block validation logic within different Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs) where the input is generated by the [execution spec tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests).

## Goal

The primary goal is to measure and compare the performance (currently in cycle counts) of running a standardized benchmarking workload (including known worse-cases) with the same stateless validation logic* across various zkVM platforms.

*We cannot guarantee the logic will be the same for targets that are not supported by the Rust toolchain. An example of this currently is Cairo.

## Workspace Structure

The workspace is organized into several key components:

- **`crates/metrics`**: Defines common data structures (`BenchmarkRun<Metadata>`) for storing and serializing benchmark results with generic metadata support.
- **`crates/witness-generator`**: A library that provides functionality for generating benchmark fixture files (`BlockAndWitness`: individual block + witness pairs) required for stateless block validation by processing standard Ethereum test fixtures or RPC endpoints.
- **`crates/witness-generator-cli`**: A standalone binary that uses the `witness-generator` library to generate fixture files. These are saved in the `zkevm-fixtures-input` folder. The crate includes Docker support for containerized deployment.
- **`crates/ere-hosts`**: A standalone binary that runs benchmarks across different zkVM platforms using pre-generated fixture files from `zkevm-fixtures-input`.
- **`crates/benchmark-runner`**: Provides a unified framework for running benchmarks across different zkVM implementations, including guest program input generation and execution orchestration.
- **`ere-guests/`**: Directory containing guest program implementations organized by program type, with each type containing implementations for different zkVM platforms. See the [Guest Program Types](#guest-program-types) section for detailed information about each type.
- **`zkevm-fixtures`**: (Git submodule) Contains the Ethereum execution layer test fixtures used by `witness-generator-cli`.
- **`zkevm-fixtures-input`**: Default directory where `witness-generator-cli` saves individual fixture files (`.json`) that are consumed by `ere-hosts`.
- **`zkevm-metrics`**: Directory where benchmark results (cycle counts) are stored by the host programs, organized by zkVM type.
- **`scripts`**: Contains helper scripts (e.g., fetching fixtures).
- **`xtask`**: Cargo xtask runner for automating tasks.

## Workflow Overview

The benchmarking process is decoupled into two distinct phases:

1. **Fixture Generation** (`witness-generator-cli`): Processes Ethereum test fixtures (EEST) or RPC data to generate individual `BlockAndWitness` fixtures as JSON files saved in `zkevm-fixtures-input/`.
2. **Benchmark Execution** (`ere-hosts`): Reads from `zkevm-fixtures-input/` and runs performance benchmarks across different zkVM platforms.

This decoupling provides several benefits:
- Independent fixture generation and benchmark execution
- Reuse of generated fixtures across multiple benchmark runs

## Core Concepts

Each zkVM benchmark implementation follows a common pattern using the EreDockerized system:

1. **Guest Program:**
    - Located within the `ere-guests/` directory, organized by guest program type and execution client (for stateless-validator).
    - For stateless validator programs: Contains implementations for different execution clients (`reth/` and `ethrex/`) with each supporting multiple zkVMs.
    - For other program types: Contains implementations organized by zkVM platform.
    - All guest programs are automatically compiled in Docker containers specific to each zkVM platform.
    - Guest programs use platform-specific mechanisms to delineate code regions for cycle counting.
    - This code is compiled automatically for the target zkVM's architecture through EreDockerized containers.
    - It reads block/witness data from its zkVM environment's standard input.
    - Uses platform-specific mechanisms (often `println!` markers) to delineate code regions for cycle counting.

2. **Host Program:**
    - Located within `crates/ere-hosts/` with unified logic across all zkVM platforms.
    - A standalone Rust binary that orchestrates benchmarking for different guest program types and execution clients.
    - Uses the `benchmark-runner` crate with EreDockerized to automatically compile and execute guest programs.
    - Supports multiple guest program types via command-line arguments (e.g., `stateless-validator`, `empty-program`).
    - For stateless-validator, supports multiple execution clients (`--execution-client reth` or `--execution-client ethrex`).
    - Automatically handles zkVM compilation and execution through Docker containers.
    - Collects cycle count metrics reported by each zkVM platform.
    - Saves results using the `metrics` crate into the appropriate subdirectory within `zkevm-metrics/`.

3. **Automatic zkVM Management:**
    - All zkVMs are now managed through EreDockerized, eliminating the need for manual toolchain setup.
    - Docker containers handle compilation, patching, and execution for each zkVM platform.
    - The benchmark runner automatically applies precompile patches as needed.

## Prerequisites

1. **Rust Toolchain:** A standard Rust installation managed by `rustup`.
2. **Docker:** All zkVMs now use EreDockerized, which means you don't need to install zkVM-specific toolchains locally. Docker handles all the compilation and execution environments.
3. **Git:** Required for cloning the repository.
4. **Common Shell Utilities:** The scripts in the `./scripts` directory require a `bash`-compatible shell and standard utilities like `curl`, `jq`, and `tar`.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd zkevm-benchmark-workload
    ```

2. **Fetch/Update Benchmark Fixtures:**

    ```bash
    ./scripts/download-and-extract-fixtures.sh
    ```

3. **Generate Benchmark Input Files:**

    Navigate to `crates/witness-generator-cli/` and generate fixture files:

    ```bash
    cd crates/witness-generator-cli
    cargo run --release -- tests --include Prague --include cold
    
    # Or generate from local EEST fixtures
    cargo run --release -- tests --eest-fixtures-path /path/to/local/eest/fixtures
    
    # Or generate from RPC
    cargo run --release -- rpc --last-n-blocks 2 --rpc-url <your-rpc-url>
    
    # Or listen for new blocks continuously
    cargo run --release -- rpc --follow --rpc-url <your-rpc-url>
    ```

    This creates individual `.json` files in the `zkevm-fixtures-input/` directory that will be consumed by the benchmark runner.

4. **Patching Precompiles**: Each zkVM requires particular dependencies to be patched for efficiency purposes.
This repository contains an `xtask` that will automate this process by calling `cargo <zkvm-name>`. See `.cargo/config.toml` for how this is setup and `precompile-patches/` for the patches that each zkVM requires.


5. **Run Benchmarks:**

    Navigate to `crates/ere-hosts/` and run benchmarks using the generated fixture files. You must specify which guest program type to benchmark. All zkVMs are now dockerized, so no additional setup is required:

    ```bash
    cd crates/ere-hosts
    
    # Run Ethereum stateless validator benchmarks with Reth execution client
    cargo run --release -- --zkvms risc0 stateless-validator --execution-client reth
    
    # Run Ethereum stateless validator benchmarks with Ethrex execution client
    cargo run --release -- --zkvms sp1 stateless-validator --execution-client ethrex
    
    # Run empty program benchmarks (for measuring zkVM overhead)
    cargo run --release -- empty-program
    
    # Run block encoding length benchmarks (with RLP encoding format)
    cargo run --release -- block-encoding-length --loop-count 100 --format rlp
    
    # Run block encoding length benchmarks (with SSZ encoding format)
    cargo run --release -- block-encoding-length --loop-count 100 --format ssz
    
    # Use custom input folder for stateless validator benchmarks
    cargo run --release -- stateless-validator --execution-client reth --input-folder my-fixtures
    ```

    See the respective README files in each crate for detailed usage instructions.

## Guest Program Types

This repository supports multiple guest program types for comprehensive zkVM benchmarking across different computational workloads. Each guest program type is designed to measure specific aspects of zkVM performance:

### Available Guest Program Types

1. **`stateless-validator`** - The primary benchmarking workload that executes Ethereum stateless block validation logic
   - **Purpose**: Measures zkVM performance on realistic Ethereum state transition computations
   - **Input**: Requires `BlockAndWitness` fixture files generated by `witness-generator-cli`
   - **Computation**: Validates Ethereum blocks using either Reth or Ethrex execution clients
   - **Execution Clients**: 
     - `reth`: Uses `reth_stateless::validation::stateless_validation`
     - `ethrex`: Uses Ethrex's stateless validation implementation

2. **`empty-program`** - Minimal program for measuring zkVM overhead
   - **Purpose**: Measures the baseline overhead of zkVM execution without computational workload
   - **Input**: No input files required
   - **Computation**: Minimal operations to establish zkVM baseline performance
   - **Usage**: `cargo run -- empty-program`

3. **`block-encoding-length`** - Measures block encoding performance with support for both RLP and SSZ formats
   - **Purpose**: Benchmarks the performance of calculating encoded length of Ethereum blocks using different encoding formats
   - **Input**: Uses the same `BlockAndWitness` fixture files as `stateless-validator`
   - **Computation**: Repeatedly calls encoding length calculation functions on block headers and bodies
   - **Encoding Formats**: Supports both RLP (`--format rlp`) and SSZ (`--format ssz`) encoding
   - **Usage**: `cargo run -- block-encoding-length --loop-count 100 --format rlp`

### Guest Program Architecture

Each guest program type follows a consistent structure across different zkVM platforms. For `stateless-validator`, there are separate implementations for different execution clients:

```
ere-guests/<program-type>/
├── reth/         # Reth execution client implementations
│   ├── sp1/          # SP1 zkVM implementation
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src/main.rs
│   ├── risc0/        # RISC0 implementation
│   ├── openvm/       # OpenVM implementation
│   ├── pico/         # Pico implementation
│   └── zisk/         # Zisk implementation
├── ethrex/       # Ethrex execution client implementations
│   ├── sp1/          # SP1 zkVM implementation
│   ├── risc0/        # RISC0 implementation (if available)
│   └── ... (other zkVMs)
└── ... (other execution clients)
```

For other guest program types (e.g., `empty-program`, `block-encoding-length`):
```
ere-guests/<program-type>/
├── sp1/          # SP1 implementation
├── risc0/        # RISC0 implementation  
├── zisk/         # Zisk implementation
└── ... (other zkVMs)
```

### Adding New Guest Program Types

The architecture is designed to be extensible. To add a new guest program type:

1. **Create the guest program directory structure:**
   ```
   ere-guests/your-new-program-type/
   ├── sp1/
   │   ├── Cargo.toml
   │   └── src/main.rs
   ├── risc0/
   │   ├── Cargo.toml
   │   └── src/main.rs
   └── ... (other zkVMs)
   ```

2. **Add the new command to `ere-hosts`:**
   - Add a new variant to the `GuestProgramCommand` enum in `crates/ere-hosts/src/main.rs`
   - Add corresponding logic to handle the new guest program type
   - Update the `get_zkvm_instances` function to point to the correct subdirectory

3. **Update documentation** to include the new guest program type in the supported benchmarks table and usage examples

## CI/CD and Docker Support

The repository includes automated Docker image building through GitHub Actions:

- **Automated Builds**: Docker images are automatically built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`) on pushes to the master branch
- **Manual Builds**: Docker builds can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch  
- **Container Registry**: Pre-built images are available at `ghcr.io/<repository>/witness-generator-cli`
- **Multi-platform Support**: Images are built for multiple architectures and cached for efficient builds

The Docker workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`) provides:
- Automatic tagging with git SHA and `latest` for the default branch
- Docker layer caching for faster subsequent builds
- Integration with GitHub's container registry with proper authentication

The Docker image provides a self-contained environment for running the witness generator without local Rust toolchain setup.
