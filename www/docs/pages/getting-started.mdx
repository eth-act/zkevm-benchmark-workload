## Project Overview

zkGas profiling is a comprehensive framework for measuring and comparing the resources needed for proving different OPCODEs in zk environments. The project focuses on analyzing the computational costs, memory usage, and proving time required for various Ethereum opcodes across different gas categories and zkVM implementations. The stateless-executor guest program reduces the re-execution of an ethereum block and witness to the transaction level without the pre and post execution validation overhead. This makes the proving resources as close to the actual execution of the instructions as possible. 

## Key Features

- **OPCODE Profiling**: Detailed analysis of resource requirements for different Ethereum opcodes
- **Gas-Categorized Analysis**: Organize profiling data by gas limits (1M, 10M, 30M, 45M, 60M, 100M, 150M)
- **Multi-zkVM Support**: Compare opcode costs across RISC0, SP1, OpenVM, Pico, Zisk, and Airbender zkVMs
- **Resource Metrics**: Comprehensive measurement of cycles, memory usage, and proving time
- **Automated Workflows**: Scripts for fixture download, generation, profiling execution, and results analysis
- **Docker-Based Compilation**: All zkVMs use EreDockerized for consistent builds

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker, Rust (1.70+), Python 3.8+, and Git installed before proceeding.

### 4-Step Workflow

1. **Clone and Setup the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/zkevm-benchmark-workload.git
cd zkevm-benchmark-workload
git checkout master-se-docs-03  # Use this branch until merged to master
```

2. **Download and Extract Fixtures**

```bash
./scripts/download-and-extract-fixtures.sh
```

3. **Generate Gas-Categorized Fixtures**

```bash
./scripts/generate-gas-categorized-fixtures.sh
```

4. **Run Benchmarks**

```bash
# Run with defaults (risc0 zkVM, reth client, GPU)
./scripts/run-gas-categorized-benchmarks.sh

# Or customize your run
./scripts/run-gas-categorized-benchmarks.sh -z sp1 -e reth -c 1M,10M
```


### Default Configuration

| Setting | Default Value |
|---------|---------------|
| zkVM | risc0 |
| Execution Client | reth |
| Resource | gpu |
| Gas Categories | 1M, 10M, 30M, 45M, 60M, 100M, 150M |
| Action | prove |

## Results Organization

The `benchmark-results/` directory provides organized access to profiling results:

- **`gas-categorized/`**: Results organized by gas categories (1M, 10M, 30M, etc.)
- **`zkvm-comparisons/`**: Results organized by zkVM implementations (RISC0, SP1, etc.)
- **`markdown-reports/`**: Human-readable analysis reports and comparisons
- **`archived/`**: Historical results for long-term analysis
