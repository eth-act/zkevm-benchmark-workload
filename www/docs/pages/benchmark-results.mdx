# Benchmark Results

This page displays the generated benchmark results from zkGas profiling. Here you can view, analyze, and compare OPCODE resource requirements across different gas categories and zkVM implementations.

## Current Results

*No benchmark results available yet. Run the profiling scripts to generate results.*

### How to Generate Results

1. **Generate Fixtures**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-gas-categorized-fixtures.sh
   ```

2. **Run Profiling**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-gas-categorized-benchmarks.sh
   ```

3. **Compare Results**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/compare_executions.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-1M zkevm-metrics-sp1-1M
   python3 scripts/compare_provings.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-1M zkevm-metrics-sp1-1M
   ```

## Results Display

## Viewing Results

### Gas-Categorized Results

Browse results organized by gas categories:

```bash
# List all gas categories
ls benchmark-results/gas-categorized/

# View results for specific gas category
ls benchmark-results/gas-categorized/10M/

# View a specific result file
cat benchmark-results/gas-categorized/10M/block_001.json
```

### zkVM Comparison Results

Compare results across different zkVM implementations:

```bash
# List all zkVM implementations
ls benchmark-results/zkvm-comparisons/

# View RISC0 results
ls benchmark-results/zkvm-comparisons/risc0/

# Compare RISC0 and SP1 results
diff benchmark-results/zkvm-comparisons/risc0/ benchmark-results/zkvm-comparisons/sp1/
```

## Generating Results

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate fixtures
./scripts/generate-gas-categorized-fixtures.sh

# 2. Run profiling
./scripts/run-gas-categorized-benchmarks.sh

# 3. Compare results between different zkVM implementations
python3 scripts/compare_executions.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-1M zkevm-metrics-sp1-1M
python3 scripts/compare_provings.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-1M zkevm-metrics-sp1-1M
```

## File Types and Formats

### JSON Metrics Files
- **Location**: `gas-categorized/` and `zkvm-comparisons/`
- **Format**: JSON files containing detailed profiling metrics
- **Content**: Execution cycles, proving time, memory usage, and metadata
- **Usage**: Raw data for analysis and comparison

## Organization Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

#### Gas Category Directories
- Format: `{GAS_VALUE}` (e.g., `1M`, `10M`, `100M`)
- Purpose: Organize results by computational complexity

#### zkVM Comparison Directories
- Format: `{ZKVM_NAME}` (e.g., `risc0`, `sp1`, `openvm`)
- Purpose: Organize results by zkVM implementation

### Archiving Strategy

#### Regular Archiving
```bash
# Archive current results monthly
mv benchmark-results/gas-categorized/1M benchmark-results/archived/$(date +%Y-%m)/1M

# Create new directory for fresh results
mkdir -p benchmark-results/gas-categorized/1M
```

## Analysis Workflows

### Quick Analysis
```bash
# Check specific gas category
ls benchmark-results/gas-categorized/10M/
```

### Detailed Comparison
```bash
# Compare execution metrics between zkVMs
python3 scripts/compare_executions.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-10M zkevm-metrics-sp1-10M

# Compare proving metrics between zkVMs
python3 scripts/compare_provings.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-10M zkevm-metrics-sp1-10M
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Results
```bash
# Check if profiling has been run
ls zkevm-metrics-*

# Verify fixtures exist
ls zkevm-fixtures-input-*

# Run profiling if missing
./scripts/run-gas-categorized-benchmarks.sh
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix directory permissions
chmod 755 benchmark-results/
chmod 755 benchmark-results/*/
```

### Disk Space Management
```bash
# Check disk usage
du -sh benchmark-results/

# Clean up old results
rm -rf benchmark-results/archived/old-results/
```

## Best Practices

### Organization
1. **Use Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions
2. **Regular Archiving**: Archive old results to maintain organization
3. **Document Changes**: Update README files when adding new structures
4. **Version Control**: Consider versioning important result sets

### Analysis
1. **Start with Latest**: Begin analysis with the most recent results
2. **Compare Systematically**: Use comparison scripts for systematic analysis
3. **Document Findings**: Add notes about significant discoveries

### Maintenance
1. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old results to keep directory organized
2. **Backup Important Results**: Keep copies of significant findings
3. **Monitor Disk Usage**: Ensure sufficient space for new results
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep README files current with directory structure

## Integration with Documentation

The benchmark results directory integrates with the main documentation:

- **Getting Started**: Overview of the profiling workflow and results organization
- **Gas Categorized Benchmarks**: How to generate the results stored here
- **Scripts**: Documentation for comparison scripts

## Examples

### Comparing Implementations
```bash
# Compare RISC0 vs SP1 execution metrics
python3 scripts/compare_executions.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-10M zkevm-metrics-sp1-10M

# Compare RISC0 vs SP1 proving metrics
python3 scripts/compare_provings.py zkevm-metrics-risc0-10M zkevm-metrics-sp1-10M
```
